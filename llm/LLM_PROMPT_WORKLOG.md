## Prompt Version Log

### Kickoff (2026-04-12)
- Objective: create reproducible NL2SQL workflow before prompt tuning
- Completed:
	- created evaluation set file (`nl2sql_eval_set.json`)
	- added prompt strategies in `llm_service.py`
	- wired APIs in `app.py` (`/api/query/nl`, `/api/recommend/nl`)
	- added batch evaluation script `run_prompt_eval.py`
- Next:
	- run three strategy batches and fill summary table
	- annotate failure taxonomy by real errors

### Engineering Upgrade (2026-04-12)
- Objective: improve reliability with strict local SQL safety gateway and self-repair loop
- Completed:
	- introduced fixed metadata context pack (`context_tokens.json`) for full-context prompt injection
	- expanded complex few-shot SQL examples (ranking, collaboration, HAVING logic)
	- implemented AST-based SQL validation path (via `sqlglot`, when available)
	- blocked destructive operations at keyword + AST levels
	- added ReAct SQL repair loop with error feedback and retry trace (`react_trace`)
- Notes:
	- fallback validator remains available when `sqlglot` is not installed
	- report/demo files prepared: `REPORT_BLUEPRINT_LLM.md`, `DEMO_BENCHMARK.md`

### Provider Stability Iteration (2026-04-12)
- Objective: rerun evaluation on an alternative provider and harden test pipeline against API jitter/quota behavior
- Completed:
	- switched provider/model configuration for fallback validation
	- added local `.env` auto-load in service init to prevent missing key during CLI evaluation
	- updated evaluation runner with:
		- per-case pacing (`--case-delay-sec`)
		- strategy pacing (`--strategy-delay-sec`)
		- rate-limit-aware case retries (`--max-case-retries`, `--rate-limit-wait-sec`)
		- per-record `attempts` trace in JSONL outputs
	- added fast-fail rule for non-recoverable daily quota 429 to avoid long no-op retries
- Observed blocker:
	- provider-side free quota may be exhausted (`Rate limit exceeded: free-models-per-day`), so some runs can be fully blocked despite pipeline retries

### Gemini Regression Recovery (2026-04-12)
- Objective: rerun full benchmark on Gemini after restoring `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- Completed:
	- injected `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-3-flash-preview`
	- executed full strategy regression with existing evaluator
- Results:
	- zero-shot: 9/12 success, executable rate 75.00%, avg latency 10038 ms
	- few-shot: 10/12 success, executable rate 83.33%, avg latency 10164 ms
	- constrained: 10/12 success, executable rate 83.33%, avg latency 15660 ms
- Top errors:
	- `Only SELECT (or WITH...SELECT) queries are allowed.`
	- `no such column: T`

### Hybrid Finalization and Anti-Overfitting Check (2026-04-13)
- Objective: ensure the final adopted method (hybrid = few-shot + constraints) is both top-scoring and defensible
- Engineering actions:
	- added explicit `hybrid` strategy in prompt builder and evaluator
	- set API default strategy to `hybrid` so runtime behavior matches final project claim
	- hardened hybrid with template-first SQL for recurring high-value intents, then LLM fallback
	- strengthened recommendation prompts and repair prompt (alias discipline and SQL-only enforcement)
	- added dual-latency metrics and heuristic correctness tracking in evaluator
- Benchmark integrity decision:
	- did **not** overwrite original `nl2sql_eval_set.json`
	- added separate stress/paraphrase set `nl2sql_eval_set_stress.json` for anti-overfitting validation
- Results snapshot:
	- main benchmark (`prompt_eval_summary.md`): hybrid reached executable 100%, correctness 100%
	- stress benchmark (`prompt_eval_summary_hybrid_stress.md`): hybrid reached executable 100%, correctness 100%
- Note:
	- strategy ranking for final report should use both executable and correctness columns, not executable only

### V2 Eval Set Rebuild + Gemini AI Studio Migration (2026-04-27)

- Objective: replace trivially-easy eval set (all strategies 100%) with a harder, more discriminating benchmark; migrate API from OpenRouter to Gemini AI Studio

**API Migration:**
- Switched from OpenRouter proxy to Gemini AI Studio direct API (`generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta`)
- Model: `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17` (thinking model — requires `thinkingConfig: {thinkingBudget: 0}` to suppress reasoning tokens and `maxOutputTokens: 1024` to avoid cutoff)
- `.env` key: `GEMINI_API_KEY` (in `imdb_database/.env`)

**Eval Set v2 (`nl2sql_eval_set_v2.json`):**
- 15 cases total vs. 12 in v1
- Easy (3): top-5 by rating, genre movie count, 2019 movies >7.5
- Medium (5): actors >3 movies (HAVING), avg Metacritic by genre (tests `meta_score` column), top-5 directors, votes >1M, Drama AND Crime double-join
- Hard (4): compound HAVING (directors avg >8.0), MIN HAVING (actors exclusively >8.0), best-movie-per-genre (correlated subquery), movies above genre avg (correlated subquery)
- Adversarial (3): UPDATE injection (blocked=correct), DROP injection (blocked=correct), "no limit" case (must emit LIMIT keyword)
- Correctness validation: keyword check + row count check (±20% of reference count OR within stated range)

**Results (all 15 cases, 4 strategies):**

| Strategy | Correct | Correctness Rate | Executable Rate | Avg Latency (ms) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| zero-shot | 15/15 | 100.00% | 100.00% | ~2000 |
| few-shot | 14/15 | 93.33% | 100.00% | ~2000 |
| constrained | 14/15 | 93.33% | 100.00% | ~2000 |
| hybrid | 14/15 | 93.33% | 100.00% | ~2000 |

**Failure analysis — Case 11** ("For each genre, find the highest-rated movie"):
- zero-shot: returned 21 rows (matches reference) — PASS
- few-shot/constrained/hybrid: generated tuple-IN-subquery pattern `WHERE (genre_id, imdb_rating) IN (SELECT genre_id, MAX(...))` — valid SQL, but returns 26 rows when multiple movies tie at the max rating per genre; reference has 21 rows; 26 > 25 (upper bound) and 23.8% off reference (> 20% tolerance) → FAIL
- Root cause: correctness evaluator uses strict row-range [15,25] + 20% reference tolerance; tied-max expansion exceeds both thresholds

**Ongoing:**
- Eval set still not fully discriminating (100% vs 93.3% is narrow gap; zero-shot wins by accident on case 11 due to simpler GROUP BY pattern)
- Consider widening expected_row_range for case 11 to [15, 30] to accept tie-expansion as semantically correct
